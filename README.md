# ez
Shell scripting to automate all the eZ Platform things!

## Purpose
I'm installing eZ Platform from scratch on fresh servers over and over again.
These are the things I typed by hand the first few times, collected into scripts.

## Potential
CLI automation is a powerful enablement feature for any platform. In the spirit
of Symfony's installer (https://github.com/symfony/symfony-installer), the
console project (https://github.com/symfony/console), Platform.sh's CLI tooling
(https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-cli), Heroku's CLI tooling
(https://github.com/heroku/heroku),
Drush (https://github.com/drush-ops/drush), and others, it would be great to
have CLI superpowers surrounding all things eZ. For right now, I'm just adding
whatever steps I'd be typing by hand so I can curl them as a single script and
run them on fresh servers. Down the road I may add functionality around existing
installations to manage/inspect.

## Problems
These first baby scripts aren't meant for anything other than my very narrow
personal use case, so it isn't very practical for others to _run_. The steps
contained in the scripts are perfectly valid reference material for those doing
some or all of the same things.
